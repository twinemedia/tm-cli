# Compile
First, make sure you have Nim and [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) installed. Then, clone the repsitory.

Once you have Nimble and the code, go into the code directory and run `nimble install`. If all does well, you will have the software installed, and available as the binary `tm` (or perhaps `tm.exe` on Windows).
